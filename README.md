### Additional Notes:
* Kindly see the doc: Face Recognition Application Based on MTCNN and FaceNet.pdf for more details. <br>

* To run the program: <br>
  * Add two subfolders named 'imgs' and 'pics' (which have it own subfolders named 'anchors' and 'resize_anchors') under the folder 'facenet'. <br>
  * Adjust file paths. <br>
  * Download the model file '20170512-110546'((1)20170512-110547.pb (2)model-20170512-110547.ckpt-250000.data-00000-of-00001 (3)model-20170512-110547.meta,etc) online.
